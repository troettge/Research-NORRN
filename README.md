# Research-NORRN

Welcome! This repository is used to manage the research module for the Norwegian Reproducibility Network.

Are you a collaborator? Then you are most likely looking for the one of the task management boards.

There are currently two boards:
- a general board keeping track of high level [Objectives & Key Results](https://github.com/users/troettge/projects/2)
- the first task management board for the project on the [Norway Open Research Survey](https://github.com/users/troettge/projects/1/views/1)
